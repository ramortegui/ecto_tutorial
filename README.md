Getting started with ecto.

This is an exercise following the ecto documentation.

- After the configurarion of the repo (following the latest commits), we are able
to create and make some queries to the database.

- mix ecto.create
Will create the database
- mix ecto.gen.migration create_people
Will create a file on: ./priv/repo/migrations/20161208044357_create_people.exs
(update the change function to create the table with the fields required.)
- mix ecto.migrate
